# Exporting graphics from draw.io to latex and word.md

draw.io is a free software to make various diagrams.

You can also easily input latex equations/symbols to a flowchart using draw.io.

However, if you want to export your diagram to vector graphics (such as SVG), it will be tricky to 
insert that to a latex or word file.

This article explains that method that I used to export vector graphics from draw.io to latex and word.

## Latex
The most convient way to inset diagrams from draw.io to latex is to save the figure to a PDF file.

You can export your figure following these steps:

1. Select the figure that you want to save.
2. Click "File"
3. Find "Export as"
4. Click "Advanced"
5. Select "PDF" from format
6. Click "Export"

Then the PDF file can be inserted to a latex file.

## Word
Use Inkscape to trafer a PDF file to SVG.
