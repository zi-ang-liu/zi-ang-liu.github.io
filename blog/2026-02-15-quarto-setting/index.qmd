Quarto projects can be configured using a `_quarto.yml` file. A sample configuration is shown below:

```yaml
project:
  type: book

book:
  title: "mybook"
  author: "Ziang Liu"
  date: "2/15/2026"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd

bibliography: references.bib

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
```

## freeze

With the increasing content of the book, it may take a long time to render the entire book. To save time, setting `freeze: auto` will only render the changed files, which can significantly speed up the rendering process.

```yaml
execute:
  freeze: auto
```

## pdf 

The following configuration can be used to generate a PDF version of the book using LuaLaTeX and the `ltjbook` document class, which is suitable for books with Japanese content.

`use-rsvg-convert: true` is required to render SVG images in the PDF output.

```yaml
format:
  pdf:
    pdf-engine: lualatex
    documentclass: ltjbook
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 1
    use-rsvg-convert: true
```

## pseudocode

```yaml
filters:
  - pseudocode
```
