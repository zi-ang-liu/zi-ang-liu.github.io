# Rebuild images/favicon.ico and images/apple-touch-icon.png from
# images/favicon.svg.
#
# Run from the repo root after editing images/favicon.svg:
#   sh _tools/make-favicon.sh
#
# Needs rsvg-convert (brew install librsvg) and Pillow (pip install pillow).
#
# Why the raster copies still exist alongside the SVG: Safari only began
# honouring SVG favicons recently, and Windows/pinned-tab surfaces still ask
# for .ico. The .ico carries 16/32/48 rasterised *separately from the vector*
# rather than one 48px image downscaled by the browser — that downscale is what
# made the old single-size icon soft in the tab strip.
#
# _tools/ is outside Quarto's render list and starts with an underscore, so
# nothing here ships to _site.
