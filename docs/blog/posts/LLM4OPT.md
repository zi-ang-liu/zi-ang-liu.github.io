      3. Multi-objective Optimization
   2. LLMs as the Generator of Optimization Algorithms
      1. Option Generation with the Cognitive of LLMs
      2. Algorithm Generation with Chain-of-Thought
2. Optimization algorithms optimize LLMs
   1. Optimization model tuning
      1. Multi-task learning optimization
      2. Based on structural pruning
   2. Self-tuning optimization
   3. prompt optimization
      1. Continuous prompt optimization
