# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Supply Chain Management

[Liu et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1177/10591478241305863) implement heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO) to solve decentralized multi-echelon inventory management problems. The  is available on GitHub at [source code](https://github.com/xiaotianliu01/Multi-Agent-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-on-Multi-Echelon-Inventory-Management).

[Oroojlooyjadid et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2020.0939) propose a DRL algorithm to train an agent to play the beer game where the other agents follow BSP or policies derived from human behavior. The source code is available on GitHub at [here](https://github.com/OptMLGroup/DeepBeerInventory-RL). 

Nazari et al. (2018) propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP).
