  abstract  = {Abstract Mobile manipulators have a crucial role in large
               manufacturing industries, production houses and retailer shops.
               Although fixed manipulator arms are very familiar in industries
               and production houses, a manipulator arm mounted on a movable
               robot equipped with the feature of autonomous navigation is still
               unfamiliar in this age. In this research, we propose an
               autonomous navigation method with A* and Q learning algorithm for
               a 6-DOF manipulator robot arm that is mounted on a movable
               2-wheeled robot and the robot can find its path autonomously in a
               dynamic environment where knowledge of the environment was not
               known to the robot previously. The robot scans its surroundings
               with laser scanners and generates a map of its environment in
               ROS. The robot’s ability to move from its current location to a
               desired destination while avoiding obstacles and optimizing its
               trajectory depends heavily on its motion planning. For motion
               planning of the manipulator robot graph based and reinforcement
               learning based algorithms can be integrated. Incorporation of
               these algorithms helps the manipulator robot to find its path to
               a known or unknown environment. The result demonstrates the
               environment map generation using laser scans in RViz and applying
               A* and Q-Learning algorithms the robot finds its path to move
               from its initial state to its goal state on a generated map.},

               constructed collaboratively and dynamically according to the
               cyber physical system (CPS) paradigm. It is necessary to build
               smart supply chains according to this concept. A network of
               component enterprises in a supply chain would be modeled as a
               virtual supply chain in the cyber world. From the viewpoint of
               Industry 4.0, virtualizing a supply chain is the foundation for
               constructing a CPS for a supply chain. The virtualization of a
               supply chain makes it easier for companies to study their
               integrating and expanding opportunities. By using this CPS,
               comprehensive and autonomous optimization of the supply chain can
               be achieved. This virtual supply chain can be used to simulate
               the planning phase with negotiation, as well as the production
               phase. In this paper, instead of specific mathematical modeling
               for each supply chain, a general configuration method of a
               virtual supply chain is proposed. The configuration method of a
               supply chain model is proposed as a virtual supply chain using
               enterprise e-catalogues. A virtual supply chain is constructed as
               a multi-agent system, which is connections of software agents
               that are automatically created from each selected enterprise
               model in the e-catalogues. Three types of component enterprise
               models are provided: manufacturer model, part/material supplier
               model, and retailer model. Modeling templates for these three
               types of enterprises are prepared, and each template is a nominal
               model in terms of enterprise’s behavior. Specific
               component-enterprise models are prepared by filling the
               appropriate template. Each component enterprise agent is
               implemented using the enterprise model selected from the
               catalogues. Manufacturer, retailer, and supplier e-catalogues, as
               well as an automatic construction system of a virtual supply
               chain, are implemented. Methods for developing templates for the
               manufacturer, retailer and supplier were provided, and the
               construction system for specific enterprise models (as
               e-catalogues) is implemented as a trial.},

               transshipment in a three-echelon supply chain is formulated as a
               Markov decision process. The supply chain consists of one
               supplier, two warehouses, and two retailers, where lateral
               transshipment is permitted between the warehouses. The demands at
               the retailers are independent and stochastic. Proximal policy
               optimization is used to find the optimal ordering policies and
               the optimal lateral transshipment policies for two warehouses to
               maximize the profit of the inventory system. To evaluate the

               been recognized as one of the significant issues in manufacturing
               systems. In most of previous studies, complex workers’ operations
               in a cell such as traveling times of multi-skilled operators in
               another cell to their workplaces, have not been considered in the
               workforce optimization model. In this paper, we consider the

               workforce assignment scheduling problem for multi-stage
               multi-item cell production lines. The problem is formulated as a
               resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). We
               propose an RCPSP formulation of the scheduling problem for
               multi-product cell production lines where the traveling time of
               operators and products are considered. The exact solution of the
               RCPSP formulation is derived by using a general-purpose solver,
               Gurobi. The validity of the RCPSP model is verified by comparing
               it with a genetic algorithm (GA) using a commercial simulation
               software (Siemens Plant Simulation). Experimental results show
               that the derived exact solution of RCPSP is better than that of

               management. Several attempts have been made to optimize the
               inventory problem using surrogate-assisted optimization methods.
               However, these studies have assumed that the decision-maker has
               access to all the supply chain information for building the
               simulation model. This study proposes a surrogate-assisted
               evolutionary algorithm for distributed simulation-based inventory
               optimization in serial supply chains. We propose a
               surrogate-assisted multi-strategy differential evolution
               algorithm. Two search strategies are used to generate candidate
               solutions, and two surrogate models filter the candidate
               solutions. A regression model is used to estimate the total cost,
               and a classification model is trained to estimate the feasibility
               of the solutions. Then, we develop a distributed simulation
               method for estimating each stage's performance for a given
               inventory policy while allowing the simulation models to be
               located in different locations. Our proposed approach is
               evaluated using 10-stage serial supply chain problems. The
               results show that the proposed surrogate-assisted distributed

               better solutions than the baseline algorithms. In addition, the

               planning and object placement planning, however, there are few
               methods that optimize both of them simultaneously. In addition,
               if these methods are to be used in actual retail stores, users

               motion planning at the same time from a simple input represented
               by a symbol sequence. We compare three types of search methods:
               random search, heuristic search with target state, combined
               heuristic and random search and UCT (Upper Confidence Tree). The

               demand for perishable commodities such as food and
               pharmaceuticals is growing. This emphasizes the need for
               effective perishable inventory management, which has become
               increasingly complex due to the perishability of these products.
               Traditional optimization methods, such as Dynamic Programming,
               require significant time and effort to solve these challenges. In
               this study, we use Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy
               Optimization, which are deep reinforcement learning methods that
               can give numerical and approximate solutions to complex problems.
               In the inventory problem considering costs such as ordering,
               storage, lost opportunities, and spoilage, we define the
               inventory status as the state, the ordering as the action, and
               the negative total cost as the reward. We conducted a performance
               comparison of the two methods with an aligned total number of
               time steps. Furthermore, through numerical experiments, it was
               confirmed that the application of both methods resulted in a cost
               reduction of at least approximately 30\% compared to the basic
               stock policy.},

               meet diverse customer demands while maintaining production
               efficiency close to mass production. Modular production is one of
               the production methods to achieve mass customization, and
               products are manufactured by combining modules. This production
               method allows a manufacturer to increase its total profit by
               manufacturing products suited to individual customers while
               reducing costs. In actual production planning, production costs
               and customer demands are uncertain. By considering these
               uncertainties, robust production planning can be achieved.
               Various robust production planning methods have been proposed in

               In order to improve work efficiency, it is also important to
               generate a collision-free trajectory in a limited space where the
               robots interfere with each other. However, in the actual
               collision avoidance motion, the robot may collide due to motion
               delay or disturbances. In particular, collisions between
               industrial robots and humans have caused fatal accidents in the
               past, and a collision avoidance motion planning method for
               multiple robot arms is required to avoid such accidents. Previous

               to reduce the burden of human labor shortage. Mobile robots are
               required to develop automated systems that can make decisions as
               flexibly like human operators. Most conventional route planning
               problems for mobile robots have been utilizing either,
               optimization methods or learning methods. However, those
               conventional methods have a difficulty in applying it to the
               conflict-free route planning problems with a large number of
               states with three dimensional environment. We propose a method
               that combines deep reinforcement learning and graph search
               methods. In the proposed method, the routing is firstly
               determined by a graph search algorithm, and Deep Q-Network (DQN).
               A deep reinforcement learning method is used to avoid collisions.
               A route planning problem in a three dimensional environment is

               novel approach, using the rapidly exploring random tree
               (RRT)-based scheme for optimizing the robot’s motion planning and
               minimizing energy consumption. Sampling-based algorithms for path
               planning, such as RRT and its many other variants, are widely
               used in robotic motion planning due to their efficiency in
               solving complex high-dimensional problems efficiently. However,
               standard versions of these algorithms cannot guarantee that the
               generated trajectories are always optimum and mostly ignore the
               energy consumption in robotic applications. This paper proposes
               an energy-efficient industrial robotics motion planning approach
               using the novel flight cost-based RRT (FC-RRT*) algorithm in
               pick-and-place operation to generate nodes in a predetermined
               direction and then calculate energy consumption using the circle
               point method. After optimizing the motion trajectory, power
               consumption is computed for the rotary axes of a six degree of
               freedom (6DOF) serial type of industrial robot using the
               work–energy hypothesis for the rotational motion of a rigid body.
               The results are compared to the traditional RRT and RRT*
               (RRT-star) algorithm as well as the kinematic solutions. The
               experimental results of axis indexing tests indicate that by
               employing the sampling-based FC-RRT* algorithm, the robot joints
               consume less energy (1.6\% to 16.5\% less) compared to both the
               kinematic solution and the conventional RRT* algorithm.},

               expensive. This study proposes a surrogate-assisted evolutionary
               optimization approach to optimize the inventory policies in
               multi-echelon distribution systems for perishable items under a
               limited number of evaluations. The random forest algorithm is
               used to build the surrogate model for a faster estimation of the
               performance of the inventory policies. A co-evolutionary
               differential evolution algorithm is proposed to simultaneously
               evolve the population through multiple searching strategies. The
               generated solutions are estimated by the low-cost surrogate model
               to select the promising solutions, which will be evaluated by the
               inventory model. Moreover, this study also integrates the
               surrogate model into two classic metaheuristic algorithms,

               new performance indicator is proposed to examine the efficiency
               of the surrogate model in evolutionary computation. Two case
               studies are used to investigate the performance of the proposed
               algorithms. The experimental results show that both particle
               swarm optimization and differential evolution exhibit performance
               improvements exceeding 55\% by using surrogate models under the
               limited number of function evaluations. Furthermore, the
               surrogate model reduces computational time for both algorithms by
               over 34\% to achieve equivalent objective values. Finally, the

               compared with 12 algorithms, and the results show that the
               proposed algorithm consistently outperforms them. These findings
               confirm the usefulness of the surrogate model in evolutionary

               optimization problem using historical data that generated by
               supply chain digital twins. The objective is to minimize the
               total costs while satisfying the required service level for a
               supply chain. The random forest algorithm is used to build
               surrogate models which can be used to estimate the total costs
               and service level in a supply chain. The surrogate models are
               optimized by an ensemble approach-based differential evolution
               algorithm which can adaptively use different search strategies to
               improve the performance during the computation process. A

               graph search algorithm for conflict–free route planning problems
               for multiple robots. In the proposed method, Q–learning, a
               reinforcement algorithm, is applied to avoid collisions using
               off–line learning with a limited state space to reduce the total
               learning time. Each vehicle independently finds the shortest
               route using the A* algorithm, and Q–learning is used to avoid

  abstract  = {A multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed in this
               paper for motion planning and layout design in robotic cellular
               manufacturing systems. The sequence-pair is used to represent the
               layout of a robotic cell, which can avoid the overlapping of
               modules. For each layout, the robot motion planning using Rapidly
               exploring Random Trees (RRT) is conducted to compute the total
               operation time. A non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II
               (NSGA-II) is used to minimize the layout area and operation time.
               The proposed method is applied to a 6-DOF (Degree of Freedom)
               robot manipulator, Niryo Ned. In the experiments, a Pareto set is
               obtained. The experimental results suggest the tradeoff
               relationship between the operation time and layout area. The
               findings show that the proposed method can efficiently solve the
               optimal motion planning and layout design problem in robotic

               mathematical models for infectious diseases has attracted
               considerable attention. In a previous study, human behavioral
               strategies are represented using evolutionary game theory and
               integrated with the SIR model of the COVID-19 epidemic. However,
               actual COVID-19 infection has an incubation period. In addition,
               due to viral mutations, the number of infected people is higher
               in the second and subsequent epidemics than in the first one. In
               this study, the previous study that uses evolutionary game theory
               to represent human behavioral selection in the SIR model is
               extended to the SEIR model. Then, considering the viral
               mutations, the relationship between the number of infected people
               and the risk of infection is formulated. The simulation results
               indicate that, by increasing the infection rate as the infection
               spread, the maximum number of infected people at each infection
               peak continued to increase until the maximum number of
               simultaneously infected people is reached. This finding indicates
               that the number of infected people is affected by the higher
               infection rate caused by the virus mutation.},

               and total energy consumption of the robot arm configurations in
               its workspace for pick-and-place operation. Firstly, the PID

               parameters of PID are then fine-tuned using metaheuristic
               algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm
               Optimization methods to create a more precise robot motion
               trajectory, resulting in an energy-efficient robot configuration.
               The results for different robot configurations were compared with

               dynamics (SDPSO) to solve single-objective optimization problems.
               SDPSO consists of four PSO search strategies. Evolutionary game
               theory is introduced to control the population state. In
               evolutionary game theory, through the interaction between
               players, better strategies will eventually dominate among the
               players. By extending this idea to PSO, a selection mechanism and
               a mutation mechanism are proposed. By using the selection
               mechanism, the adoption probability of the high payoff strategies
               will increase. The mutation mechanism can examine the stability
               of the incumbent strategy to evolutionary pressures. The
               performance of SDPSO is compared with 14 algorithms on the CEC
               2014 test suite. The results show that SDPSO has the highest
               rank. SDPSO is applied to solve a real-world problem. SDPSO can
               find the best mean results comparing with 4 algorithms. The

               closed-loop supply chains and how these policies impact the
               market demand and the returning strategies of manufacturers and
               retailers. This paper presents a design of closed-loop supply
               chains under government regulation by considering a novel
               three-stage game theoretic model. Firstly, Stackelberg models are
               adopted to describe the one-shot game between the manufacturer
               and the retailer in a local market. Secondly, based on the
               Stackelberg equilibriums, a repeated and dynamic population game
               is developed. Thirdly, the government analyzes the population
               game to find the optimal tax and subsidy policies in the whole
               market. To solve the proposed model, the idea of backward
               induction is adopted. The results suggest that, by collecting tax
               and allocating subsidy, the government can influence the market
               demands and return rates. The centralized supply chain structure
               is always preferred for the government and the market. The

               low-profit remanufactured products. The environmental attention

  abstract  = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an efficient optimization
               algorithm and has been applied to solve various real-world
               problems. However, the performance of PSO on a specific problem
               highly depends on the velocity updating strategy. For a
               real-world engineering problem, the function landscapes are
               usually very complex and problem-specific knowledge is sometimes
               unavailable. To respond to this challenge, we propose a
               multipopulation ensemble particle swarm optimizer (MPEPSO). The
               proposed algorithm consists of three existing efficient and
               simple PSO searching strategies. The particles are divided into
               four subpopulations including three indicator subpopulations and
               one reward subpopulation. Particles in the three indicator
               subpopulations update their velocities by different strategies.
               During every learning period, the improved function values of the
               three strategies are recorded. At the end of a learning period,
               the reward subpopulation is allocated to the best-performed
               strategy. Therefore, the appropriate PSO searching strategy can
               have more computational expense. The performance of MPEPSO is
               evaluated by the CEC 2014 test suite and compared with six other
               efficient PSO variants. These results suggest that MPEPSO ranks
               the first among these algorithms. Moreover, MPEPSO is applied to
               solve four engineering design problems. The results show the
               advantages of MPEPSO. The MATLAB source codes of MPEPSO are
